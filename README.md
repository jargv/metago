# metago - A metaprogramming language for Golang

Metago isn't really a whole language, it's more like
a framework for writing "code mods" and code generators in
Go's template language ("text/template").

# Rationale

One of Go's strengths is its simplicity. For most code this
simplicity is very beneficial. However there's a certain
kind of code where Go's simplicity can start to get in the
way. Examples of this include the `sort` package and
other cases where one would traditionally use generics.
Other examples include boilerplate code such as the code
generated by `stringer`. The goal of metago is to help keep
Go simple by adressing the (very few) downsides of
simplicity.
